# Calculator-GUI-with-Python
In this I have created a Calculator GUI with Python programming language. Here I have used the Kivy package in Python to build a Calculator GUI.
Kivy is a free, Open Source Python library that enables the rapid and easy development of highly interactive cross-platform applications. Kivy’s execution speed is the same as compared to the other mobile development alternatives like Java for Android and Objective C for iOS.
Additionally, Kivy has the huge advantage of being able to run on multiple platforms, just like HTML5 does; in this case, Kivy works best because it doesn’t rely on a heavy browser, and many of its components are implemented in C using the Cython library so that most of the graphics processing runs directly in the GPU.

Kivy offers an excellent balance of performance and portability in various hardware and software environments.
